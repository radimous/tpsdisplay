# TPSDisplay

adds tps and mspt to the player list list  
same format as carpet mod, so [minihud](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud) and [bocchud(forge port of minihud)](https://modrinth.com/mod/bocchud) can display it  
by default no one can see it and players have to enable it for themselves with `/tpsdisplay enable` and disable it with `/tpsdisplay disable`  
if you are op, you can change the default with `/tpsdisplay enabledByDefault true` or `/tpsdisplay enabledByDefault false`
