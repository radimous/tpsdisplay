# TPSDisplay

Server-side mod that adds tps and mspt to the player list  
Uses same format as carpet mod, so [minihud](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud) and [bocchud(forge port of minihud)](https://modrinth.com/mod/bocchud) can display it  
No one can see it by default and each player has to enable it for themselves with `/tpsdisplay enable` and disable it with `/tpsdisplay disable` (ops can use `execute as` if they want to enable/disable it for them)
